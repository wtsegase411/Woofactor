## Brief Description of Project 
 Our team has joined this project to help with early stage research into how to understand and then automatically generate the basic architecture of a song, which is called it's "chord progression".

For this project, we worked on developing a tool that allows us to digitally represent songs at the grammatical chord progression level. Based on that chosen representation scheme, we extended the tool to be able to predict where the song could go.
## Description of Deliveralbles
1) Digital represenation scheme <br/>
This includes a song model of chord progressions using Roman numerals. We represented the songs by breaking each song into an ordered list of progressions which each contain collection of lines. Each line contains list of chords and number of beats next to the chords if the number of beat is not four. The lines are then contained in a form along with the keys of the song. The form then makes up the structure of the song.
