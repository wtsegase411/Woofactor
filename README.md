# Woo Factor Music 

Woo Factor Music is a company that creates music for use in television, film and advertising.

## Brief Description of Project 
 Our team has joined this project to help with early stage research into how to understand and then automatically generate the basic architecture of a song, which is called it's "chord progression".

For this project, we worked on developing a tool that allows us to digitally represent songs at the grammatical chord progression level. Based on that chosen representation scheme, we extended the tool to be able to predict where the song could go.
